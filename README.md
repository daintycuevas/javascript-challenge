# javascript-challenge
ALIENS-R-REAL dataset

In this assignment, some challenging events occurred. During the first atttempt of completing UFO-level 1 actions of filtering data by date was accomplished; however, the filter button was not functional. UFO dates will only filter when value is pushed with the enter key. 

With an attempt to fix the filter button challenge and add the other search options, another challenge was encountered - in actually filtering the data. 

The next step was to append the filtered results. This was accomplished but not with the assigned headers. 

Prior to including more functionalities on the page, filtered results can be nicely viewed, which I do not clearly understand. 

At this point, filter search is functioning with formatting issues on the UFO javascript-challenge.
